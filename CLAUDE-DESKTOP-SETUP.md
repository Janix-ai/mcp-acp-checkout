    "demo-shop": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/Users/scott/AI/mcp-acp-checkout/examples/demo-shop/server/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY": "sk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No tools available"
- Restart Claude Desktop completely (Cmd+Q, then reopen)
- Check the config file path is correct
- Verify Stripe key starts with `sk_test_`

### "Module not found" error
- Make sure you ran `npm install` and `npm run build` in demo-shop/server

### "Invalid API key"
- Double-check you're using the **test** key, not live
- Key should start with `sk_test_`
- No extra spaces in the config file

### Payment fails
- Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Make sure you're in Stripe test mode
