# Project Status - October 25, 2025

## ✅ PAUSED - Ready for v0.1.0 Beta Release (Next Session)

### What's Working
- ✅ **SDK builds cleanly** - TypeScript compiles without errors
- ✅ **29 automated tests passing** - Full E2E test coverage
- ✅ **Demo shop builds and runs** - Example integration verified
- ✅ **Claude Desktop integration** - MCP tools discovered and working
- ✅ **Complete shopping flow** - Search, add to cart, set buyer info, create payment link
- ✅ **Stripe Checkout** - Payment links generate successfully
- ✅ **Real payment completed** - Stripe test payment processed successfully
- ✅ **GitHub repo live** - Code pushed to https://github.com/Janix-ai/mcp-acp-checkout

### Recent Fix (Oct 25, 2025)
**Problem:** Stripe Checkout returning 401 errors  
**Root Cause:** Using `apiVersion: '2025-02-24.acacia'` which requires special Stripe account approval  
**Solution:** Removed specific API version, now uses default Stripe API (works on all accounts)  
**Result:** ✅ Payments working perfectly

### Testing Completed
- ✅ SDK direct API tests (29 tests)
- ✅ MCP tools integration with Claude Desktop
- ✅ Natural language shopping flow
- ✅ Cart operations (add, remove, update quantity)
- ✅ Buyer information collection
- ✅ Payment link generation
- ✅ Real Stripe test payment ($49.00 completed successfully)

### Testing Remaining
- ⏳ Test with Cursor (nice to have)
- ⏳ Test with Claude.ai (nice to have)
- ⏳ Test with Goose (nice to have)

### Known Issues
- None! Everything working as expected.
